# Generator of worksheets for English Irregular Verbs

This is a Python generator for worksheets about English Irregular Verbs.
It generates a PDF page with a table of 20 lines, with a clue about the verb to guess.

Each line is unique, and the clue is positioned randomly in the table.
In the code, it's possible to specify the number of worksheets to generate.

Each table is randomly generated, so it's very rare that you'll get the exact same table twice, even if you generate thousands of worksheets.
